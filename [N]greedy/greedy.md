# greedy

## intro

- greedy algorithms is to pick the locally optimal solution at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum
- dp vs greedy
    -  in dp, we solve overall problem by combining the solutions about subproblems
    -  in greedy, we make a series of localized optimal choices without considering the overall problem

## pattern

- greedy
    - we need to make the locally optimal choice
    - sometimes, use sorting or heap can help us make greedy choice
