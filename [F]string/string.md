# string

## intro

- terms
    - palindrome
        - use two pointers
    - anagram
        - use hashmap
        - need to have same length
    - substring
        - is contiguous like subarray, not like subsequence
    - subsequence
        - by deleting some chars
    - prefix and suffix
    - trie
        - can insert and search in `O(L)`
    - isomorphic
        - use hashmap
        - build bijection mapping relation

## pattern

- **traverse from end**
    - traverse from last idx
    - or reverse whole string first
- **handle valueâ€™s bound**
    - be aware of the negative number
- **use chunk**
    - every chunk starts with 4 char (byte) to represent the the length of string in chunk
- **use rabin karp**
    - find pattern match / substring in string can use Rabin Karp (rolling hash)
        - time `O(n)` or `O(n+m)`
        - space `O(n)`, due to hashset or `O(1)`, due to finding fixed hash val
        - should consider the collision problem
            - solution 1: use 2-choice hashing
            - solution 2: when find match, check the substring really match or not. worst time could degenerate to `O(nm)`
- **trivial case**
    - make sure be familiar with syntax of string
